# dev rules

## keeping track of things

when large changes are being done, track the tasks, changes, and high level design decisions in a markdown, stored in docs/

always make sure you've checked if there's a relevant doc!

## remembering the design

a succinct but complete DESIGN.md in the project root should always be maintained to reflect the app and serve as a starting point for understanding the codebase

## maintaining a readme

the readme should always be kept up to date with the project. but keep it succinct.

## python uv

this project uses python uv.

## backend

sqlite, fastapi, and whatever is needed to download vids

## testing

no unit testing unless the users requests it. simple integration testing is good and should cover most of the codebase.
