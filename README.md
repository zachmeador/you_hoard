# youhoard

A youtube archiver app that cares about simplicity and feature richness.

`youhoard` uses sqlite, fastapi, and yt-dlp. No need to spin up redis, elasticsearch, kubernetes, or terraform a new data center just to have a webapp that makes yt archiving easier. 

Also, no front-end framework. 

## Current status

Version: 0.0.1

Very alpha, not worth trying unless you want to submit PRs.

Missing many features that I want, will be added over time. 

## Is it vibe coded?

Yes.
